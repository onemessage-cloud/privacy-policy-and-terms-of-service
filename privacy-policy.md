# **OneMessage Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy describes how OneMessage ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our messaging management platform (the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## **1\. Information We Collect**

We collect various types of information to provide and improve our Service to you.

### **1.1. Personal Data**

While using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Data"). This may include, but is not limited to:

- Email address
- First name and last name
- Phone number
- Company/Workspace name
- Billing information (e.g., payment method details, billing address â€“ **note: we do not store full credit card numbers; these are handled by our secure payment provider**)
- Usage Data (as described below)

### **1.2. Usage Data**

We may also collect information about how the Service is accessed and used ("Usage Data"). This Usage Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

### **1.3. WhatsApp and Messaging Data (Crucial Information)**

When you connect a WhatsApp account or other messaging service to OneMessage, we collect and process data related to your messaging activities.

IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING WHATSAPP:

OneMessage does NOT use the official WhatsApp Business API provided by Meta. Instead, we rely on a custom API solution designed to communicate with WhatsApp. This unique approach allows our platform to be used by a broader range of WhatsApp accounts, including personal WhatsApp numbers, not just official WhatsApp Business API accounts.

Data we collect and process via this custom API includes:

- **Conversation Content:** Messages sent and received through the connected WhatsApp numbers or other channels (text, images, videos, documents, audio).
- **Contact Information:** Names and phone numbers of contacts you communicate with through the Service.
- **Message Status:** Delivery, read, and failure statuses of messages.
- **Channel Identifiers:** The WhatsApp phone numbers or other channel identifiers you connect to our platform.

You are responsible for ensuring that your use of WhatsApp (including connecting your number to OneMessage) complies with WhatsApp's own Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. OneMessage is not affiliated with WhatsApp or Meta.

## **2\. How We Use Your Information**

OneMessage uses the collected data for various purposes:

- To provide and maintain our Service
- To notify you about changes to our Service
- To allow you to participate in interactive features of our Service when you choose to do so
- To provide customer care and support
- To provide analytics or valuable information so that we can improve the Service
- To monitor the usage of the Service

## **3\. How We Share Your Information**

We may share your information in the following situations:

- **With Service Providers:** We may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service ("Service Providers"), to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services, or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used. These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
- **For Business Transfers:** If OneMessage is involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data may be transferred.

  - Protect against legal liability
- **With Your Consent:** We may disclose your Personal Data for any other purpose with your explicit consent.

## **4\. Data Security**

The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## **5\. Data Retention**

We will retain your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.

We will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our Service, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer periods.

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us.

## **7\. Third-Party Services**

Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## **8\. Children's Privacy**

Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 18 ("Children"). We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.

## **9\. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. We will let you know via email and/or a prominent notice on our Service, prior to the change becoming effective and update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.
