# **OneMessage.cloud Terms of Service**

Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms," "Terms of Service") carefully before using the OneMessage.cloud platform (the "Service") operated by OneMessage.cloud ("us," "we," or "our").

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.

## **1\. Service Description**

OneMessage.cloud is a messaging management platform designed to help businesses and individuals streamline their customer communications. Our Service provides a unified inbox, automation tools, contact management, and analytics for various messaging channels.

IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING WHATSAPP INTEGRATION:

OneMessage.cloud integrates with WhatsApp through a custom API solution, NOT the official WhatsApp Business API provided by Meta. This unique approach allows our platform to be used by a wider range of WhatsApp accounts, including personal WhatsApp numbers, enabling users who do not have a WhatsApp Business API account to leverage our powerful features. OneMessage.cloud is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by WhatsApp or Meta.
